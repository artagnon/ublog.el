* Structure and file layout
** twapi.el for standard Twitter API interfaces: Need to complete
** twsuperapi.el for additional interfaces: New ideas go here. Document well!
** twhttp.el handles all HTTP communication- Most of it is ripped out from http-get.el and http-post.el
** rewrite.el that binds together everything. Will be renamed later
** twhelper.el for all commonly used misc macros. Will probably get rid of this later
* The TODO priority list
** Clean up and streamline the HTTP GET and POST interfaces in twhttp.el
*** Rip out similar code from other files such as rewrite.el
*** Drop http-cookies.el: Let's just use OAuth
** Finish off twapi.el for the standard Twitter API interfaces
*** Especially the OAuth section for premature testing purposes
** Write in authentication into twitel-authenticate() in rewrite.el using OAuth from twapi.el
*** Finish this off asap for premature testing to work
** Figure out how to parse json response using the standard json library. Write code into sentinel
** Dump new ideas into twsuperapi.el
* Learning assignments
** How does OAuth work?
** Learn good structure from hober's projects, especially couchdb.el
** Processing the output of json-read-from-string
** Become familiar with raw HTTP communication for GET and POST requests
** Learn DP retreival from twittering-mode.el
** How to make links "clickable"? It's a font property. Learn from twittering-mode.el
** DP image caching
** Caching Twitter timeline updates
** Limiting number of API hits to maximum permitted in an hour using a timer
* Progress tracker
** Unit testing
